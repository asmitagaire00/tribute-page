        <h2>Timeline of Nightingale's Life</h2>

          <dd>
            She was born in Italy to William Edward Nightingale and Frances
            “Fanny” Nightingale. She had one sister. Florence was born into a
            rich, well-connected British family. Florence was raised at Lea
            Hurst where she received classical education which included German,
            Italian and French. By the time she reached 16, Florence, who always
            had a very keen interest in philanthropy and caring for the sick,
            knew her calling was nursing. She believed without doubt that this
            was her divine calling.

          <dt>1844</dt>
          <dd>
            Pursuing a career in nursing was looked down upon by the society at
            that time, especially for someone with an affluent background. After
            much opposition, Florence announced her decision to enter the field
            in 1844.

          <dd>
            She enrolled herself as a student at the Lutheran Hospital of Pastor
            Fliedner in Kaiserwerth, Germany. She then worked hard to educate
            herself in the art and science of nursing.

          <dd>
            Florence returned from the Crimean War, four months after the peace
            treaty was signed, and she hid herself away from the public’s
            attention. Florence returned to England as a national hero but she
            was deeply shocked by the mass death that took place right before
            her eyes because of poor sanitation. Therefore, she was determined
            to begin a campaign that would improve the quality of nursing in
            military hospitals. She started investigating before the Royal
            Commission on the Health of the Army and that resulted in the
            formation of the Army Medical College.

            When the Indian Mutiny broke out in 1857, she wished to come to
            India and help improve the sanitation facilities. Even though she
            could never come, she played an instrumental role in getting a
            Sanitary Department established by the Indian government.

            Florence dies at her home at 10 South Street, Mayfair, in the West
            End of London and was buried at St Margaret’s East Wellow, near her
            parent’s home, Embley Park in Hampshire.
